# Minimal CMake Template for Qt 5 Projects

*This branch is for Qt 5. Visit [main](https://github.com/euler0/mini-cmake-qt/tree/main) branch if you are looking for the Qt 6 template.*

This is a minimal, but complete and production-ready CMake project template for Qt 5 projects. This may be a starting point for your new application. If that is not intent to be a cross-platform project, you can clean up that stuffs from the template.

## Features
  * Handling all possible Qt stuffs (UI, resources, ~~translations~~)
  * macOS bundle
  * Windows executable icon
  * Use of modern [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for much easier compiling
  * Setup for tests using [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest)
  * Continuous testing with [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), with support for C++17 and C-11.
